ZPID guix channel
=================

This is a GUIX_ channel containing packages not in GUIX, but in use at
leibniz-psychology.org. See `Using a Custom Guix Channel`_ how to add it to
your installation.

While we try to follow upstream, this channel is only guaranteed to work with
`our own GUIX fork`_. If possible all packages are going to be submitted to
upstream sooner or later.
