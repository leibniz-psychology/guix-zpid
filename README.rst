ZPID Guix channel
=================

This is a Guix_ channel containing packages not in Guix, but in use at
leibniz-psychology.org_. See `Using a Custom Guix Channel`_ how to add it to
your installation.

The packages in this repository are currently only tested with older versions
of Guix, namely the one present at https://github.com/leibniz-psychology/guix.
We try to sync with upstream occasionally, but if something breaks in the
meantime, please open an issue.  Whenever possible possible, packages will be
upstreamed to Guix proper and disappear from this channel once accepted.
